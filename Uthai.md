- With its beginnings as a small northern outpost for explorers, Uthai quickly grew into a sprawling city.
- Uthai was originally settled by goliaths, and still has a larger relative population of Goliaths than anywhere else in [Emberfall](./Emberfall.md).
- Uthai is named for the goliath deity Naki-Uthai, god of mountains, climbing, and bravery.
