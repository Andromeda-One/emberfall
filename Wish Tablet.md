Functionally similar to a scroll, this is an arcane tablet made out of some sort of stone or mineral that allows one to cast the spell Wish.
The cost that the spell comes at is not small, the tablet has five indentations where the caster is meant to place five gemstones worth 10,000 GP each.

*Other than the added material cost, there are no mechanical differences between this and a Spell Scroll. This uses the variant spell scroll rule "Scroll Mishaps."*
