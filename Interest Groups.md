# Political Parties
Each political party has its own color, symbol, and outline motif. Lords each have a unique insignia that represents them, and denotes which party they represent. The current leadership of a settlement is displayed on banners hung around that settlement. Each settlement has a unique outer banner section that represents the settlement, and the insignia of the current lord is then placed in the center of the banners. The settlement section can be altered in a process similar to that of the lord elections.
