# Timeline
This is written from the perspective of [King Oswald Idris](./King%20Oswald%20Idris.md).
## 42 A.U.
[The Imperialists](./Political%20Parties.md#Imperialist%20Party) are bidding for the [High Senate](./High%20Senate.md) majority again. There is talk of further expansion. Was [Rowe](./Jameson%20Rowe.md) not satisfied with all of the Mainland?
## 17 A.U.
Father has stepped down, today I take his place as king of Emberfall.
## 14 A.U.
My daughter was born today, but our celebration is to be short-lived. Reports tell of a growing extremist group known as the "[Unblemished](./Political%20Parties.md#The%20Unblemished)", who would have my head for even looking at this beautiful child.
## 13 A.U.
Today I am married to my beautiful wife, [Queen Lursha Idris](./Queen%20Lursha%20Idris.md). The public's reception of this decision has been quite mixed.
## 1 A.U.
Father finally dealt with the spirits in [Wraithhold Woods](./Wraithhold%20Woods.md). Good riddance. It will be nice to ride through there again, I've missed that from when I was a boy.
## 0 A.U.
[The Great Unification](./The%20Great%20Unification.md) is complete. After three months of bloodshed, the hunger of [the Imperialists](./High%20Senate.md#Imperialist%20Party) has finally been sated. All it's taken was several hundred lives and control over all corners of the Mainland. I cannot believe my father is in support of this.
## 21 B.U.
I was born.
## ≈300 B.U.
The [Frostspires](./Frostspires.md) appeared around this time. Apparently before the presence of the [Frostspires](./Frostspires.md) there, there was some "eternal blizzard" in the area, cause unknown. Similar to the transformation of [Mount Fa'Uch](./Maw%20of%20Fa'Uch.md), the books tell of a group of goliaths from [Uthai](./Uthai.md) venturing into a thick blizzard, however this group was never seen again, and shortly after their disappearance, the blizzard cleared to reveal the newly formed [Frostspires](./Frostspires.md).
## ≈400 B.U.
The books say that dwarven warriors ventured to the heart of [Mount Fa'Uch](./Maw%20of%20Fa'Uch.md) and slayed some beast of myth there, though they do not state the nature of the beast. My guess is that it was some great elemental, whose death subsequently caused the mountain to explode and become the volcano we can see there today.
