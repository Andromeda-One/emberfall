# Welcome to Emberfall!

You're new here, right? Okay good, if you weren't I would have looked stupid for saying that to you.


Just a heads up, here we use a ten month system! It might be a bit confusing at first but I promise it makes a lot more sense in the long run.


Alright first I recommend you take a look at [this handy dandy timeline](./Emberfall.md) that [King Oswald](./King%20Oswald.md) wrote up for us!


Then you should look at this map!
-insert map here :)-


Now that you know every single thing there is to know about Emberfall, you can set out on your adventure! Or whatever you're here to do.
